# THE HUMAN VOICE

1. What can we learn from the most "embodied" form of music creation (voice literally happens INSIDE you body!)?
2. What are the mechanisms that we have talked about in .club that have parallels to the way humans create sounds with their mouths? Do the vocalists think about these things differently?

- "Singer's Formant" 2800-3200hz "resonance" "mask"
- "harder" to not sing with it in some ways!
- NOT nasal! Different than twang
- breath and articulators -- balancing act of making sure things are 'in the right place'
  - articulators: anything above the lungs! breath is the origin tho. Get out of the way of it!
- letting go
- context matters
- feels delicate
- the breath is everything! what does it mean to be connected to you breath, as a vocalist or otherwisse?
- Somatic trickery works! thinking about light coming out of your will effect the way you sing

3. What are some things computer music people might not think about when thinking about voice? (how the sound comes from within, intonation, vibrato, relaxation)

- breath matters! not infinite
- being thoughtful about "length" -- consider making it breath length
- emotional state is really important (cuz it is right in front of you)
- The hard thing should feel easy (eventually)
- vocal chords are involuntary muscles, so thinking metaphorically might actually be more useful!
- finding "Gesture" within music - "what is the physical shape of a sound"

QUESTIONS:

1. what do computer music people feel like while they perform?

- striving for flow state - but can be disembodied
- midi instruments like ewi make it easier to embody

2. How do you _find_ you "voice"?

- find yourself! safely

3. What are interesting ways to bring "gesture" into performance if bodies aren't a limitation? (data sonification)
4. Why perform?
5. Getting around the limitation of the body might be the point and that is ok!
6. Virtuosity, what's it got to do with it? Is it pulling us away from out bodies? spectacle
7. How can we use technology to give differently abled people get access to expressive potential?
8. Why sing?

How to make computermusic more embodied:

- perform with other people!

i guess we should have defined embodied first oops
maybe it is not about the body
do you love the sound, do you love your body, do you love your voice

# PROCESSING

How do these things effect the way singers sing?

- Amplification via close or not close microphones
- Reverb (natural and/or synthetic)
- Delay (short and long)
- Distortion
- Pitch Shifting
- Auto tune
- Harmonization
- EQ
- Timbre transfer
- Compression (hard to demo)

Other effects people want to talk about?

# HOW TO CONTROL IT ALL

- "doing it in post" might be the easiest way to think about all this stuff!
- Have a friend drive the bus (me in this case)
- knobs, dials, and screens might not be the best interface for live vocal control (what does it do to a singer to be "stuck" behind a controller)
