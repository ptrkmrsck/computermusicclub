Huge topic!

## Project Example

- video to midi
- text

Problems that come up:

- Does it matter if you can "hear" that it is data?
- Why is it annoying when people use the vegetables to make music

The Human in the middle!
Truth!
Existential dread of commodification of sound art

## Mike's thing

- taking the "work" that his team did and sonifying it -- git commits converted into midi!
- File Count + Date

Leaves in the wind are the original data sonification

Is code a data structure?

Music Notation?

Fluency
Prosthetics
Latency
Cybernetics
